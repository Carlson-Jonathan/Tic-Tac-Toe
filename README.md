# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple Tic Tac Toe game I made on a Saturday morning while teaching my son C++.

   Random Tic Tac Toe game I made in about 2 hours on a 
   Saturday morning as I was teaching my son C++. Several
   of my co-workers had to create games like this for
   their university classes so I figured I would give it
   a shot. I could probably dress it up with SFML, but
   a simple game deserves a simple gui.
